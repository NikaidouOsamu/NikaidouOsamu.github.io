I am a first-year doctoral student at the Chang'an University [School of Future Transportation](https://wljtxy.chd.edu.cn/). My research interests include urban rail transit, transportation geography, and smart cities.
I am very fortunate to have received guidance from [Professor Sun Jian](https://js.chd.edu.cn/jiaotong/sj2/list.htm) of the Chang'an University [School of Future Transportation](https://wljtxy.chd.edu.cn/). I hope to move forward steadily and deepen my academic career step by step.
